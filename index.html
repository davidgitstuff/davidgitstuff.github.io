	<p>I am bad at words. They tend to belie my true intentions, imply hidden agenda where there is none, or best case scenario, just make me look stupid.</p>

	<p>This blog is just my little dear-diary. Absolutely nothing I write here is intended to offend. Qutie the opposite. If anyone does gain any entertainment from anything I write, firstly, that's good and I'm glad, and secondly, I worry for you.</p>

	<p>Click <a href="/blog">here</a> to enter my entirely mundane yet opinionated world, or choose a post from the red-headed box-thing at the bottom.</p>
