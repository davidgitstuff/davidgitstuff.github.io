<div>
	<p>I am bad at words. They tend to belie my true intentions, imply hidden
	agenda where there is none, or best case scenario, just make me look stupid.</p>
	<p>This blog is just my little dear-diary, but cool since it's on the computer
	and has nothing to do with Tumblr. If anyone gains any entertainment from
	anything I write on here, firstly, that's good and I'm glad, and secondly,
 	I worry for you.</p>
