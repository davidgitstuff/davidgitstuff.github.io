title: bad at words

<div>
	<p>I am bad at words. They tend to belie my true intentions, imply hidden
	agenda where there is none, or best case scenario, just make me look stupid.</p>
	<p>This blog is just my little dear-diary, but cool since it's on the computer
	and has nothing to do with Tumblr. If anyone gains any entertainment from
	anything I write on here, firstly, that's good and I'm glad, and secondly,
 	I worry for you.</p>
	<p>Click <a href="/blog">here</a> to enter my entirely mundane yet opinionated
	world, or choose a post from the red-headed box-thing at the bottom I have only
	just decided to affectionately refer to as testarossa. That probably won't stick.</p>
