This is one of my better ideas of the month. Drunk ghost-hunting. Depending on your intonation, and with a lack of hyphenation, there could be some confusion over the objective. To clarify, the ghost-hunters would be suitably inebriated, have GoPro cameras strapped to their heads and let loose upon "haunted" locations. The ghosts would not be drunk. OR WOULD THEY?

I am almost certain that ghosts don't exist, as I have tested their existence many times by calling upon them to haunt my best mate, unbeknownst to him. He hasn't mentioned anything paranormal yet, so it's pretty safe to assume they aren't hanging around here at the very least. I also can't help but think the most haunted places on the planet wouldn't be old creaky houses, but rather the Playboy Mansion and other similar locations.

I very much like the ghost-hunting TV shows, if only for the enjoyment I get out of watching perfectly safe people unreasonably on edge. I think alcohol would only add to the inability to rationalise things, as long as the ghost-hunters are kept in the buzzed zone and not in a lethargic stupor.

I guess I find panic and fear amusing, in some weird empathic response to their plight. If you quoted that sentence alone I would sound like some kind of psycho, but I wouldn't find it at all funny if the people were in any kind of imminent danger. The only thing they are really getting spooked by are themselves and each other. It seems to be a common guilty pleasure, as ghost-hunting shows are still two-a-penny despite them always coming up bust at the end of absolutely every episode. I guess a part of me also hopes that one day they do find something, if just to see the ramifications.

I wonder why we do have these obsessions with ghosts, and I place aliens in this same category. Originally I had assumed it was just simply a search for the unknown, but we don't have people searching for magic or super-powers in the same way. Maybe we do? I should Google this later.

I think the real reason ghosts and aliens have such a strong following is because, as a species, we are so romantically social. The thought that we as humans are alone is not only a scary one, but a sad one. We are constantly reminded every day of how fleeting our existence in this universe is by the science that we do understand, that it makes the hope that there is something more, or someone out there, intoxicating. We get drunk on these ideas.

I know that some people are absolutely adamant that ghosts exist, either by virtue of hope or experience. I would never want people to think that I'm disrespectful of these beliefs.
