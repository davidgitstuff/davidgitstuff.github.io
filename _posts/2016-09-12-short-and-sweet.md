Short post tonight because I'm working on a little side project to keep myself busy. I also have a really stiff neck and headache which are making concentrating ten times harder. Luckily the cat has set up shop on the bed and is sitting within a foot of my feet, which is her little way of checking I'm ok without showing too much affection.

I don't have much to write about today, but for the sakes of continuity I though it best to write something. I had a little read over the previous days posts to get an idea of what someone might experience should they stumble across here and binge-read the whole shebang.

Incoherent and self-important are two words that come to mind. I think I need to put a much more lengthy warning on the homepage to make sure that people understand what they are getting into. I guess it's like hearing you own voice. Don't get me wrong, I have a very healthy love for myself, and this is not some self-deprecating rant, but I really don't think I would be friends with myself at first meeting. I'll do another full assessment in some posts time.

I think the problem is that I write these on separate days, after new and potentially different experiences, after realising and learning new things. I have no doubt I'll look back some when in the future and think myself a complete idiot for what I've said. The only thing I must promise is that I continue to create posts in a discrete way, not to project or promote any kind of overall image.

Each post is like a little puzzle piece from seemingly different puzzles that must somehow be pieced together. Please don't read into that. I wrote that sentence specifically to come back and read in the future and despise how ridiculously pretentious it sounds. Puzzle pieces was probably a better blog name, though. Dammit.
