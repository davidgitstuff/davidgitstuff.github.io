It is warm today, too warm to safely store food outside. There was a homeless man in town with a bottle that looked suspiciously like it was filled with egg yolks. Firstly, they will spoil quickly, surely? Secondly, why? I'm no expert on these things but isn't the yolk the worst bit of the egg for you? I had considered that maybe he was feeding them to his dog, but I don't think it's part of a normal dog diet. Where did he even get them anyway? So many questions, so few answers. I decided to let it go after briefly checking this wasn't another magical-bottle related dream.

It got me thinking about the good ideas and bad ideas I have. This blog is one that I struggled with for a while, worried that I would come across as self absorbed or pretentious. Jury is still out on whether it has been a good or bad idea, but so far it has been something I've enjoyed.

My favourite bad ideas are the harmless ones. My best mate, considered to be a brother by now, had the wonderful idea at college to position himself as the "mysterious, silent and broody guy" at the back of his class. I truly admire how committed he was to the endeavour, seeing how it played out over an entire year. In one of the most graceful defeats I have ever witnessed, after the final day of the year he just took it on the chin and admitted it was a complete bust. Instead of being the subject of subtle glances, whispers and coy smiles, he quite simply didn't exist in that class. This is the part I love about it, it was just such a bold gambit. It wasn't as if it was his only option, he is a handsome chappy that has always done well with the ladies. It was just a wild idea that was no doubt executed perfectly, gone wrong.
