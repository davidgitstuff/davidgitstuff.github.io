When I was very young I tended to get worked up over the small, trivial things in life. I think it's a universal constant that young people feel the world is against them, but I feel that's because they haven't had long enough for life to kick their ass.

I think I was lucky in my youth that I grew up in relative comfort with a supportive family. The manta my dad lived by was that he would make sure I had everything I needed in life, but not everything I wanted. Dad isn't the most sympathetic, empathetic or tactful person on the planet, but he would always make sure you are on the right path. I've talked about Mumsy before, and I genuinely believe a greater person has never existed. My sister is a few years older than me, and although we aren't particularly close, we know that we would drop everything if either of us needed help. I'll throw my best mate in here, too, when considering family. Can't forget the kitty-cat either.

As I got a bit older the laws of probability took over and I started rolling snake eyes. I won't go into any depth here about the bad luck as I think that's bad form. Suffice to say certain things changed my perspective on life and what really matters. I do very much appreciate that none of my afflictions were anywhere near as world destroying as some unlucky people are burdened with every day around the world, and my heart genuinely goes out to them.

The good news is that by and large I'm at one hundred percent now, and every day I'm grateful for it. Everything has taught me to not sweat the small things, or the big things that you can't change. The things you should concern yourself with are the things you can change, be it for yourself, or for the betterment of those you care about.

I've had to cut huge chunks out of this post, as when I re-read it I couldn't stand how whiney and broken it sounded. The last thing I ever want people to think is that I feel hard done by in life. I am lucky in the grand scheme of things. I love life, because I get to love the people and things that matter, and they know who they are whether they are listed here or otherwise.
