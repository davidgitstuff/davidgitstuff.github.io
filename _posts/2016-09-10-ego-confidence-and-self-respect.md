The three tend to get confused and intermixed sometimes. For me the former is disposable, the latter indispensable, and confidence is an absolute requirement in moderation.

The concept of ego for me is purely defensive, obviously self-serving, and an admission of fear of reflection. Ego is fickle, like packing sand into a cracked stone and expecting it to last. The cracks get bigger, the sand washes away, and you are left with broken parts.

The ability to entertain an idea without necessarily agreeing with it is the hallmark of strong foundations. I have been wrong on so many occasions, I'm still getting things wrong today. Often times I would bet the farm that I'm right and whoever I'm speaking to is an idiot, but then have to eat humble pie as I'm seemingly ported to a parallel universe where everything is backwards.

You should always be confident in decisions you make, what you say and how you say it. That should always be a product of experience and knowledge. There is no shame in being new to something or lacking in-depth understanding, but there is shame in pretending.

Confidence should always be self cultivated. If your confidence is intrinsically linked to someone else, you are in for a bad time. Ego is often fuelled by others, and can be easily built so very high. The problem is that the taller the ego, the smaller the rocking of the foundations has to be for it to all come crashing down.

Self-respect should never be something that you will compromise for others. You should always be critical of yourself, and introspective of your thoughts, but never let anyone else tell you how to do this. Who you are, how you behave and what you value in a moral sense should be absolute. Nothing and nobody should be able to change you as a person, and neither should you want or need them to.

Self-awareness, respect, and reflection are such important ingredients for growing better as a person, but as with everything good, it is the harder route to take. They allow you to build confidence over ego, allowing disagreement to not ruin your day. You are able to accept that someone might have a difference of opinion without it being a grave injustice and affront to you and what you believe. They allow you to accept issues and resolve them without it destroying you as a person and better understand the point of view of others.

In short, you should discard ego, maintain confidence and never, ever, compromise your self respect. By and large most people you meet are probably just assholes. Try not to let them ruin your day.
