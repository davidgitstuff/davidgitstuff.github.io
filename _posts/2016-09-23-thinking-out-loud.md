I watched "The Fountain" again today. If you haven't seen it, the trailer doesn't help one bit in understanding what on earth is going on. There seems to be a simple premise that is congruent throughout the various stylistically different ways in which it is told in the movie, it's just hard to keep track of it with all the vastly different imagery thrown at you. Bordering on pretentious, and some might consider it way over the line, but I am a sucker for the story that is underpinning the entire movie. It is heart-wrenching, so be warned, but definitely one you can come back to.

The movie reminded me of the overly florid poetry we studied at school. I confess I am a bit of a fan of poetry, with it being the ultimate way to veil emotion and simple meaning with euphemism and metaphor. The ultimate way to express yourself without being blunt.

For me there is a romance in provoking thought and emotion, where the meaning behind something is more a question of interpretation than absolute. It nurtures understanding.

With all this being said, there are times when things need to be blunt. I don't want a bottle of bleach telling me in a long-winded, roundabout and poetic way not to drink it.
