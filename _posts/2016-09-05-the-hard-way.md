Mumsy and I were laughing about how I was trouble when I was younger. Not real trouble, just the same kind of trouble as any kid. Kids are also really mean, and I think most people can look back and regret some of the things they have said and done to their family and the people they love. It is so very easy to hurt someone, yet so difficult to build someone up.

Mum says if you wanted to be on the front page of a newspaper tomorrow there are some easy ways and hard ways to do it. We all know the easy ways, as most of the news we see on the front page nowadays is absolutely awful. It is much easier to do something heinous than glorious.

I think this is the crux of it. It's just easier not to care, not to think about the things that we have done wrong, or our wrongdoings to others. Turn a blind eye, pretend you didn't notice, and if nobody else did then you are squeaky clean. It is easier to justify any action if everyone around you does the same. We slip into a collective apathy where nobody is willing to put the effort in to just be good.

I am not a paragon of virtue, I am fundamentally flawed in the same way as most people, but the one thing my mum has taught me above all else is to always be kind, never cruel. If I'm considered even half as good a person as mumsy, I've done alright in life.
