Sounds a bit like something Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid would come up with. As much as I like to use little lines like this in a throwaway fashion, discipline and control are two things that I think are fundamental in growing up and being a decent human being. Both can be applied to pretty much anything and everything, from physical work to handling emotional stress.

Recently I decided to learn to type properly. I had tried when I was younger, but just slipped back into old habits. I decided to really go for it a few months ago, and for a while had actually managed to completely forget how to type altogether whilst transitioning between the styles. All it took was to force myself to do it, and not quit when the going got tough. In the end it was a worthwhile skill to learn. My typing was already fairly fast with the bodged method I had taught myself over the years, but horrifically inefficient and I'm sure much less accurate. The site I used was keybr.com in case anyone else is looking to learn. All it takes is a bit of discipline and stubbornness.

In regards to emotions, everyone at some point(s) in their lives has the world turned upside down and gets driven to clown-town by someone they care about. Often you see it coming, sometimes you don't. Investing emotionally in someone rightly carries this risk, as without it, I dare say you aren't invested at all. Most of the time when relationships hit bumps it's about how you handle them.

I've always been a major believer in communication. For me it is the best way to smooth everything out, but I realised recently that not everyone feels that way. Sometimes people just don't want to talk. It's here that the discipline and control comes in. It's about putting your feelings aside for the better of the relationship, about being understanding of the bigger picture. There is no quick-fix cure-all for emotions, what one person can shoulder, another person might not. Sometimes people just need to vent. Nobody is saying it's easy, it's one of the harder things you have to do in life, but remaining disciplined and controlling yourself is in the best interests of everyone involved.

As the 1980 hit "Hold on Loosely" by 38Special professes, you guessed it, "hold on loosely, but don't let go". It's a pretty good song to boot.
