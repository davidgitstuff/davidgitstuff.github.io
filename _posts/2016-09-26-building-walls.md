Been spending some evenings playing a game called Minecraft. For those who have no idea what that is, think computerised Lego. It is one of the most relaxing games I have ever played, and ever so rewarding when you put something together and it just works. There are community made expansions available in the game, allowing some absurdly complex machinery to be built. One clever chap actually built a computer inside Minecraft.

It started off nice and mind numbing, carving out a little plot of land one evening, and building a tiny wooden house. I made little potato and carrot patches outside with a wonderful marble garden path connecting them. Then my world was invaded by a technologically advanced outsider.

I think it made me realise we should be very careful when making first contact with aliens. This one was hostile, immediately berating my inefficient vegetable patches and demanding I tear down the raspberry bushes I had neatly lined up at the end of the garden. Within an evening my small wooden house had literally been undermined, with a dark dungeon placed under it to grow superior metal berries that we would apparently later be using to build machines. My garden path was ruined.

The next evening I was trying to get to grips with the huge technological advancements I had made in just one evening. The industrial revolution had come and passed in little under an hour. I had fallen into the metal smelter and desperately mined myself to safety at least twice. The day before all I had to worry about was how many potatoes would turn out to be poisonous, now I was planning the jetpack upgrades.

It's been a super fun learning experience, with what I thought was a simple building game turning into something far more complex. I guess that it's a decent enough analogy for life. It's easy to sit and pick carrots and potatoes, but when the outsider drops the arcane knowledge on you, listen up. Never be afraid to learn, and never be afraid to be wrong.

I feel bad making posts that are as mundane and inane as this. I also feel bad about writing nothing at all. The dream diary may have to make a comeback sooner than I expected. I realised the other evening how easy it would be to just sit here and bullshit, much like most people seem to do on the internet. I'm trying to keep this as real as I possibly can.

I've had a lot of time to reflect lately for one reason or another. I don't like to share absolutely everything on here because I believe some things are personal. Contrary to the blog-creating type, I'm actually a super private person.
