I've tossed around the idea of a podcast with my best mate Andy for a long time. When we were in our teens we made a demo CD for the local radio station and dropped it through their mailbox. I like to think that somehow the CD was damaged in transit or they weren't tech savvy enough to load the MP3 saved onto it. The truth is they probably thought we were idiots.

I can't remember the pseudonyms we used, but they were probably something we thought sounded super "radio" and awful. Our greatest names to date came whilst playing a Zombie survival video game, where we were two lone wolves thrust together by circumstance and a dire need for canned food. Him as Carousel, part of a failed super soldier experiment, and me, Delicious, part time survivor, full time danger-maker. They say you can learn a lot from someone by how they behave when there is no consequence, and Andy never killed a single person in the time we played together. He tried, just missed a lot. I like to think he missed deliberately.

There is a chance that we may make the podcast dream come true one day, and if we do I then I'll be sure to post it here.
