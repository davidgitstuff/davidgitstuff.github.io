I have an Icelandic friend who recently lost his hamster. The hamster lives in a hole in his wall now, and has done for a few months. I like to ask him how the re-capture of the elusive hamster is going every time we talk, but today he admitted defeat. The hamster, in his own words, just outsmarts him. It apparently comes out in the evenings and nights to steal food and water from the dog-bowls, and if it sees him get up will scurry off to the home within the walls before he has a chance to get close.

I think he struggles with the whole situation. He knows the hamster probably has a nice little life in the walls, with much more space to explore and thrive in. The fear is that she will hurt herself somehow in the kitchen.

Every now and then these little problems crop up in life. Sometimes it's fair because you have landed yourself there, and sometimes your hamster escapes and gives you some tough choices to make.

The hardest ones are the situations you just can't win. You're damned if you do, and damned if you don't. You can't do or say the right thing, because there is no right.

At this point I would love to lay down the sagely wisdom and tell you exactly how to handle these situations. Short answer is I don't know. I wish I knew, I really, really do.
