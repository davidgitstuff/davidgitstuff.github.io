Was looking at the Haribo rings today that come in most of the different mixes offered. I'm not a huge fan of gummy sweets in general, apart from the eggs and hearts, but the rings at least do serve the dual purpose of fashion and sustenance. I confess the idea of wearing a single Haribo ring to important gatherings has crossed my mind on multiple occasions, if only to see who is well versed enough in treats to notice.

Fashion is a weird one to me, as is makeup. The latter I have no personal experience of wearing, and the former I have only dabbled with when I was very young and trying too hard. As I got older, and I'm not that old just yet, I realised its easy to look the part without having to rip holes in, or draw symbols on things. I feel the same way about other people too. Don't mistake my words for saying that you shouldn't care about your appearance, because you definitely should as it is a fundamental part of being social.

The most beautiful people I know are normal. One girl I know is particularly well dressed for any occasion, but seems to know how to dress in such a way that is never over the top. Casually she looks amazing, formally she looks radiant, couch potato mode, cute, but in any situation she is never over dressed. There is beauty not only in what she wears, but in the ability to wear the right thing.

As for makeup, I really do appreciate the art behind it, especially the fancy pictures some people draw on their nails. However, I have never met a girl I thought was more beautiful with makeup than without. At the risk of sounding absurdly clich√©, the true beauty is in the smile, the laugh, the heart, the glint in the eyes and the bare-faced honesty of it all. How could there be anything more beautiful than someone trusting you enough to reveal what they will hide from others, physically and otherwise?

The likelihood is that everyone who is reading this is the most beautiful person in the world to someone, even if you haven't met that person yet. It sounds like a really tired platitude that is spouted by parents to their ugly children, and it probably is. It also ends up being true.

I guess my rants always lead me to some conclusion that is always a surprise even to me, especially when I'm staring through a packet of Haribo intently trying to decipher meaning of all my ridiculous little thoughts. I guess I never realised how much honesty and trust mean to me.
