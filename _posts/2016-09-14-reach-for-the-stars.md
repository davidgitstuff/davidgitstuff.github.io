"Reach for the stars, and if you miss you still might get the moon". I may be paraphrasing slightly but this was the gist of the quote thrown out by none other than John Fashanu, the man to me most famous for hosting the UK version of "Gladiators". I was pretty young, and it was one of the first times that I questioned whether all adults really knew everything. I concluded I wasn't sure I agreed with The Fash on this one. Whilst I respect his remarkably simple catchphrase of "Awooooooga", I fear that he has added a defeatist stance on the famous idiom.

"Reach for the stars". It doesn't need some kind of caveat appended to it. I've always seen the meaning to be that we should never stop reaching, never rest on our laurels and always strive to be better. Not to say that it should be applied to everything in life, sometimes it's nice, and rightly so, to simply not care about something, where "that will do" is "good enough".

When you do find something that is worth reaching for, don't let yourself down by accepting the moon. Awooooooga.
