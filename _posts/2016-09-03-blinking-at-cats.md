I read on the Internet that a cat blinking at you is effectively it giving you a kiss, or saying it trusts you, one of the two. I have a cat, I adore her. She is not affectionate. She is a rescue cat and was born on the mean streets, loves eating flowers, drinking rain water, and is deathly afraid of anything she doesn't recognise. Despite this, she does her best to pretend that she cares very little about anything.

Finding out the little blinking fact started a tend in which I blink at cats. It probably looks super weird to anyone who sees me doing it. Before you try it, please note that it is a slow blink, not rapid seizure blinking. That would be weird. Even a cat would think that's weird.

There is a cat living up the road, his name is Monty. He's a fancy pure cat but that's about it. My cat is fiercely, and embarrassingly, territorial. Monty is a much younger cat, however she has taken a distinct disliking to him in particular. I worry about this, because he has absolutely no idea she hates him. He is blissfully unaware of pretty much everything in life. I regularly pick him up to give him a little cuddle when he comes by, and the sheer astonishment in his eyes every time he lifts-off is adorable, like he truly believes he has gained powers of levitation. I feel guilty putting him down, but always promise him another flight next time he turns up. I tried blinking at Monty, and he stared blankly at me. There isn't much going on behind those eyes. Part of me worries that my cat hit him too hard on the head.

In the end, a cat blinking might not have anything to do with affection, but I like to think it does. My cat seems to like it when I blink at her. It's the small, regular and reliable gestures that are the making of all relationships, and when she blinks back it makes everything worth it.
