The second post. The second glimpse into my brain where the more judgemental of you have already decided is either an OK place, or a den of depravity.

Unfortunately, just for today, there will be nothing interesting going on. I have spent the whole day trying to make this blog work. It is one of the more abusive new relationships in my life, an emotional rollercoaster I had no idea I was jumping on to. Just a few of the following have occurred due to the stress of things just not working or breaking:

1) Aggressively chewed gum to the point where my jaw feels like I could bite through the TV remote with ease.

2) Waited twenty minutes for the site to update. In this time I made a pair googly-goggles out of two halves of a pingpong ball and an elastic band. The band was too tight around my giant melon head and the edges were sharp. Don't try this at home.

3) Figured I had updated the wrong files so the twenty minutes were wasted. Put spare pingpong ball in my mouth to blow it across the room in a rage, almost inhaling it in the process. Very stupid.
