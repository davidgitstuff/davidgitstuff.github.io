It's only when I sit down to write that I realise how boring I am. I can't sit here and tell adrenaline fuelled tales of derring-do, but I'm ok with that. I genuinely love life, and I don't need to skydive or bungee jump to feel alive. The little things in life give me joy.

I was waiting for my eye appointment a few months ago. As I was finding a seat in the waiting room, there was a couple leaving with their young child. He was getting carried by mum, but was so immaculately dressed, with far better style than I had ever had at that age, or any age after. Cool little white trainers, blue jeans and I think a little jacket, he was dressed to impress. For me it just shows how much mum and dad love him, and it bought a little smile to my face knowing that kid is going to be alright in life. The smile turned into a grin once the mum turned around to point to something she had left behind, with the baby dummy planted firmly in her mouth. It wasn't that funny, but in an adorable situation it just tipped me over the edge. I do hope the little dude's eyes are ok.

It's been another quiet couple of days, which is nice in itself. It give me time to think and take stock of what I do have. I've been able to work on my little side project, which is another nice little creative outlet, not dissimilar from this. The quiet days also give me time to catch up on horror movies, which I LOVE.

Right now I'm planning to get an early night, throw a zombie movie on the Amazon box-thing, and no doubt give myself nightmares about the undead.
