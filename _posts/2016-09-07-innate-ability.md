Messi, Federer, Mozart, Einstein and the guy who used to cut my hair in under 2 minutes when I was a kid. Some people seem to have innate talent or ability built in. We all know someone like it, who quite simply excels at whatever they apply themselves to. Don't get me wrong, these people work hard and spend years perfecting their trades, yet I know given the same amount of practice, ninety-nine percent of people would fall vastly short.

There is something seductive and mystical about such talent, especially when it elevates someone above their peers. What makes the phenomenal tick? Are their brains better? Do they think faster? Does time seem to move slower for them, and can they see more complex patterns? Do they just want it more?

Every now and then we run into someone new that gives us a glimpse of that. It is absurdly confronting, but I think it's important to have enough humility to appreciate it whenever the perceived limits we put on things are blown away seemingly effortlessly.

It's all too easy to just brush these people off as edge-cases who were lucky, or no-lifers who spend too much time practicing. I think there is more to it than that. The brilliant, to me, seem unburdened by their talent or that of those around them. There are still tortured talents, but to reach the pinnacle of their greatness they seem to always been serene. Maybe it's that serene clarity that separates the brilliant from the good.

It must be lonely for the greatest. Lionel Messi can't go on YouTube for inspiration or motivation to improve. Maybe that's why he is the best, because he blazed his own path that nobody could keep up with instead of waiting for someone to do it for him. Never looking down at everyone from the top of the mountain, he built a rocket ship and blasted off to the stars. He probably enjoys the view out of the window whilst I'm struggling to beat my keepie-uppies record in the garden, though.

I guess when I see someone excel, I always question the limits of what is and isn't possible. I like to consider myself as quite open-minded about most things, knowing that I don't have anything licked to the point at which I can't improve. It's humbling to think that the worlds greatest surgeon probably has a healthier grasp over his limitations than his abilities and knowledge. Maybe that is what drives the best, the knowledge that there is more to gain, learn or achieve. Not accolades and prizes, or beating their opponent.

The important thing is to be critical of who the phenomenal truly are. Fashions come and go, with tribal and cultish followings for idiots who just shout really loud about how good they are at things. The absolute talents will blindside you on some idle afternoon and just leave you questioning "how?". I guess the answer is that they don't entirely know either.
